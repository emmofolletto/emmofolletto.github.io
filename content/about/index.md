Hi, I'm Emma!  I've been in the software engineering industry in Silicon Valley as an individual contributor (IC) for well-over a decade.  I wrote lines and lines of code, how-to guides, technical documentation, all of it.  I've learned some truths in the process.  Code gets refactored, rewritten, and replaced; documentation becomes stale and obsolete.  What matters to me are the people behind it all: teaching others, figuring out better ways to collaborate so we can get shit done.

Now that I'm in engineering management, I also write a lot. I write to explain, to clarify, but most importantly, to create meaning.  I want to get better at writing and collecting my thoughts.  Though I write mostly for myself, I hope you find some value (or entertainment) in perusing them.
