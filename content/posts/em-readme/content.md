# Motivation
This basic guide outlines how I operate as an Engineering Manager (EM).  As I evolve, so will the contents of this document.  Think of it as an extended introduction for our collaboration!

# About Me


# My Role
My job is to create opportunities for accomplishment and growth for you.

# My Expectations
- management style: blend between transformational and coaching
- 

# 1:1s
bi-weekly
coaching
seniority
critical phases during a project
stability on team and company

- shared document of notes, takeaways, to do



# Communication

- communication overhead

# Engineering Beliefs
- Implement the product roadmap, save 30% for IC-driven, foundational improvements to tech
- Create space for dialog with ICs to refine priorities

- Understand processes must meet the needs of people
individuals and interactions over processes and tools
working software over comprehensive documentation
no silver bullet

- understand the system and the architecture you are supporting





- Identify critical systems that need to change and critical features that need to be built (Prioritization)
- Identify pain points from individuals to get better context into what's not working well and what can be improved
- Identify timelines by zooming out and zooming in
- rough deliverables
- Iterations
- Exercises in explaining things from different angles reinforce learning and understanding and is pivotal to influencing direction of the business
- Be comfortable with unknowns and ambiguity.  Clarity comes over time.
- Identify risks as soon as possible, upfront
- Run project and adjust as you go
- Reflect! Run sprint retros, post-project retros, post-collaboration retros, etc.
