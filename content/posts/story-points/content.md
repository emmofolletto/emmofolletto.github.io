Getting better at estimating and breaking down deliverables into smaller chunks for your sprint not only benefit the business (better coordination and planning, mitigating risk) but can also benefit you! When we plan out our sprints, we aim to create a sustainable and manageable work pace. We commit to what we can, and we deliver what we commit to.
There are many techniques to estimation depending on what phase of project planning we’re in. T-shirt sizing and S.W.A.G., for example, can be helpful when early on in planning. (They can be used to describe an estimate derived from a combination of factors including experience, general impressions, and heuristic or approximate calculations rather than an exhaustive search, proof, or rigorous calculation.)
Story Points are a Conversation
As we continue on our journey of implementation and shipping, we know more about the tasks at hand. This means that estimates are expected to be refined later, when we get more information. A 2 point for one person may be a 3 point for another person – this is okay! We use story points to examine a task, come up with ideas to approach a problem during the sprint.
Story points can also be a weak signal to indicate planned investment on a task. (e.g. depending on the scope and complexity of a project, it might be recommended to spend a sprint on a tech spec.)
Tech debt can slow you down. When accounting for this in your estimates, it is important to surface this information so that we can address tech debt more strategically (Tech OKRs) instead of accepting tech debt in our development process.

Spikes
Sometimes creating a spike task is necessary during the software development cycle. Spikes give us a way to time-box exploration — you can use it to prototype a potential solution, write down notable unknowns in a one-pager, pick a path / compile comparison solutions etc.
Guiding Principles
This is where story points come in (after we have refined the scope of what we are delivering and identify as many unknowns as we can):
For story point estimations on tickets, there are a couple schools of thought where you can estimate by technical complexity or translated time. I recommend using the estimate to capture “ideal developer days it takes to get the task done, no meetings or minimal distractions“ using the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8).
While creating your tickets, gauge the complexity of the issues based on the examples listed below.
Make sure your tickets have estimates either before the next sprint planning or immediately after.
Ideally, no tickets larger than 5 points. Any tasks larger than 8 points (or what can be accomplished in one sprint) should be broken up into smaller pointed tickets.
Sometimes it is prudent to create a factor for unknowns and risk. If you don’t have all the information you need, you might want to start with a conservative factor of 2*estimate. This can be discussed during backlog grooming or sprint planning together as a team.
